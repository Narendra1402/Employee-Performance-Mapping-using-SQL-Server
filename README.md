## üß† About ScienceQtech

ScienceQtech is a startup specializing in Data Science, with work spanning fraud detection, self-driving cars, drug discovery, customer sentiment, supply chain, and more.

With the appraisal cycle approaching, the HR team requested a full-fledged SQL-based report analyzing employees, their roles, performance, and project engagements.



## üéØ Purpose & Objectives

- **Goal:** Extract, analyze, and optimize employee-related data for better business decisions.
- **Role:** Data Analyst (Junior DBA)
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Wrote and optimized SQL queries.
  - Built views, stored procedures, functions, and indexes.
  - Used CTEs, ranking functions, and window functions for advanced analysis.



## üîë Key Deliverables

‚úÖ Solved 20+ business questions\
‚úÖ Created reusable views, stored procedures, and UDFs\
‚úÖ Improved performance with indexing & optimization



## üóÇÔ∏è Datasets Used

| Table             | Description                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |

## üßæ Sample Questions Solved

```sql
SELECT EMP_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, GENDER, DEPT
FROM employeeRecord;
```

```sql

       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY EXP DESC) AS RANK_EXP
FROM employeeRecord;
```

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.fn_StandardJobProfile (@exp INT)
RETURNS VARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
  -- Logic to assign titles based on experience
END;
```

```sql
WITH RankedSalaries AS (
  SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DEPT ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS rk
  FROM employeeRecord
)
SELECT EMP_ID, FIRST_NAME, DEPT, SALARY
FROM RankedSalaries
WHERE rk <= 3;
```
